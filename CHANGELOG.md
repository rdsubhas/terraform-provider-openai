# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Establish the repository as the independently maintained `rdsubhas/openai`
  provider, with Go module path `github.com/rdsubhas/terraform-provider-openai/v3`.
- Prepare signed protocol-v6 releases and the HCP Terraform public namespace for
  the first stable fork release, `v3.0.0`.

### Migration
- Existing `mkdev-me/openai` state must be reassigned with `terraform state
  replace-provider` before upgrading to `rdsubhas/openai`.

### Fixed
- Admin-API calls are now paced by a token-bucket rate limiter (default 6
  RPM with a burst of 4) in addition to the v2.2.6 concurrency semaphore.
  Empirical testing on 2026-05-07 found the admin API throttles per-endpoint
  at ~7-10 RPM (no `x-ratelimit-*` or `Retry-After` headers exposed): seven
  sequential `GET /v1/projects/{id}/roles` calls succeed, the next seven in
  the same minute return 429, and the bucket refills after ~60s. The
  v2.2.6 concurrency cap was therefore insufficient — even one-in-flight
  sequential calls 429 once the per-minute bucket is exhausted. A real
  `terraform plan` against 14 distinct projects now completes without 429s
  (vs. failing under v2.2.6). Override defaults via `OPENAI_ADMIN_MAX_RPM`
  (clamped `[1, 600]`) and `OPENAI_ADMIN_BURST` (clamped `[1, 100]`).

## [2.2.6]

### Fixed
- All admin-API calls now pass through a per-process counting semaphore
  (default 3 in-flight, override via `OPENAI_ADMIN_MAX_CONCURRENT`,
  clamped to `[1, 64]`). Terraform's parallelism (default 10) was bursting
  requests faster than the per-request retry+jitter (v2.2.3) could absorb;
  the retries themselves stacked under load and kept colliding with the
  rate-limit window. Serialising at the provider level — independent of
  Terraform's parallelism flag — is necessary on top of retry+jitter. (See
  v2.2.7 for the additional rate-limit fix once empirical testing showed
  concurrency capping alone was still insufficient against the admin
  API's per-minute ceiling.)
- `openai_project_group` Create no longer issues a paginated list of all
  groups in the project after a successful POST. The POST response itself
  is the project-group object, so we parse it directly. The list-and-find
  fallback now runs only on the idempotent "already exists in project"
  path. During a parallel apply attaching N groups to one project, this
  reduces 2N admin-API calls (POST + paginated list per group) to N (POST
  only), which keeps the admin rate limit from 429'ing the apply mid-flight.

## [2.2.4]

### Fixed
- The `openai_project_role` data source (singular and plural) and the
  `openai_group` data source (singular and plural) now share their admin-API
  list calls across invocations via per-process caches, so a `terraform
  plan` that declares N role lookups against M projects and K group lookups
  resolves to M + 1 admin-API list calls instead of N + K. Roles are cached
  per project ID; groups are cached once for the org. Without this, retry
  alone (added in v2.2.3) was insufficient — concurrent paginated lookups
  for the same data still bursted past the admin rate limit and 429'd
  repeatedly even with jittered backoff.

## [2.2.3]

### Fixed
- All admin-API HTTP calls in the `openai_project_group` resource (Create/
  Read/Update/Delete), the `openai_project_user` resource (Create/Read/
  Update/Delete), and the `openai_group` data source now retry on `429 Too
  Many Requests` and transient `5xx` responses, using the same backoff
  helper introduced in v2.2.1. Previously only the `openai_project_role`
  data source (v2.2.2) and the v0→v1 state upgrader (v2.2.1) were covered,
  leaving plans that read groups and applies that create/update/delete
  project memberships exposed: a `terraform apply` attaching ~14 groups to
  a single project consistently failed with `API error listing project
  groups: 429`.
- Backoff schedule now applies full jitter (actual sleep is uniformly
  random in `[base/2, base]` for base values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30s). Without
  jitter, N concurrent requests that all 429 at the same moment retry on
  the same instants and keep colliding; jitter spreads them out and lets
  the rate-limit window drain.

## [2.2.2]

### Fixed
- The `openai_project_role` data source (singular and plural) now retries on
  `429 Too Many Requests` and transient `5xx` responses from the admin API,
  using the same exponential backoff helper that the state upgrader uses
  (introduced in v2.2.1). Without retry, a `terraform plan` declaring many
  `data "openai_project_role"` lookups against the same admin API can burst
  past the rate limit and fail the entire plan with `Status: 429 Too Many
  Requests`.

## [2.2.1]

### Fixed
- The `openai_project_user` state upgrader (added in v2.2.0) now retries on
  `429 Too Many Requests` and transient `5xx` responses from the admin API
  using exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s). The admin
  `GET /v1/projects/{id}/roles` endpoint is rate-limited; without retry, a
  state upgrade migrating many resources can burst past the limit and fail
  the entire `terraform plan`. Honours the `Retry-After` header when present.

## [2.2.0]

### Added
- State upgrader for `openai_project_user` to migrate state stored under the
  pre-v2.1.0 schema (string `role`) into the current schema (set `role_ids`).
  Users upgrading from v2.0.0 no longer need manual `terraform state rm` /
  `import`: the upgrader resolves the prior role name to its role ID via the
  admin API and writes it into `role_ids` transparently on the next plan.
  Lookups are cached per project inside the provider process so a plan over
  many resources in the same project performs a single role-list call rather
  than one per resource.

### Migration notes
- The upgrader requires an **admin API key** (the same one already required
  to manage project users in normal operation). Operators whose existing v0
  state was created without admin credentials configured must provision an
  admin key before running `terraform plan` against the new provider,
  otherwise the upgrade fails with
  `admin API key is required to resolve project role`.
- The upgrader fails closed when the prior role name no longer exists in the
  project (renamed/deleted role). This is intentional: silently writing
  `role_ids: []` would revoke access on the next apply. If you hit this,
  investigate the affected project before retrying.
- `openai_project_group` was introduced in v2.1.0 and has no prior released
  schema, so no migration is needed for it.

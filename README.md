## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.25.8 (for development)
- OpenAI API Key

## Installation

### Using Terraform Registry (Recommended)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    openai = {
      source  = "rdsubhas/openai"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "openai" {
  api_key = var.openai_api_key
}
```

### Migrating from `mkdev-me/openai`

The fork has a different global provider address even though its resource schemas are
compatible. Back up your state, replace the provider address, update your
`required_providers` block, and reinitialize:

```bash
terraform state replace-provider \
  registry.terraform.io/mkdev-me/openai \
  registry.terraform.io/rdsubhas/openai
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
```

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the complete migration procedure.

```bash
# Build the provider binary
make build

# Build and install the provider locally for testing
make install

# Build for multiple platforms (creates ./bin/ directory with cross-compiled binaries)
make release

# Clean up built binaries and temporary files
make clean
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Format Go code
make fmt

# Run linting checks
make lint

# Run acceptance tests (requires valid OpenAI API keys)
make testacc
```

#### Testing with Examples

To test the provider with specific examples, navigate to the example directories:

```bash
# Test a specific example
cd examples/chat_completion
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make your changes to the provider code
# 2. Format and test your code
make fmt lint test

# 3. Run acceptance tests (optional, requires API keys)
make testacc

make clean
```

#### Environment Variables for Testing

Set these environment variables for testing:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY="your-admin-key"  # For admin operations
export OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID="your-org-id"  # Optional
```

#### Documentation

Make sure to run `tfplugindocs` if resources are updated.

## Releasing

Releases are built, signed, and published by GitHub Actions from an explicit stable
semantic version tag. HCP Terraform owns the active `rdsubhas` public namespace and
ingests published GitHub releases through the Terraform Cloud GitHub App.

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the release procedure and signing-key setup.

## Testing

### Environment Setup

Set the required environment variables:

```bash
# Option 1: Export directly
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
export OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY="sk-admin-..."  # Required for organization resources

# Option 2: Use a .env file
cat > .env << EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY=sk-admin-...
EOF
source .env
```

### Testing Examples

Use the test script in `testing/`:

```bash
# Quick verification test
./testing/test_examples.sh quick

# Test all examples (plan only)
./testing/test_examples.sh plan

# Test a specific example (plan only)
./testing/test_examples.sh plan image

# Test with real resources (apply + destroy)
./testing/test_examples.sh apply chat_completion

# Test all examples with apply (WARNING: creates resources!)
./testing/test_examples.sh apply

# Clean up all terraform files
./testing/test_examples.sh cleanup
```

### Manual Testing

You can also test examples directly:

```bash
cd examples/chat_completion
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## Basic Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    openai = {
      source  = "rdsubhas/openai"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "openai" {
  # API key and organization ID are read from environment variables:
  # OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID
}

# Create a chat completion
resource "openai_chat_completion" "example" {
  model = "gpt-4"
  
  messages {
    role    = "system"
    content = "You are a helpful assistant."
  }
  
  messages {
    role    = "user"
    content = "Hello, how are you?"
  }
}

# Output the assistant's response
output "response" {
  value = openai_chat_completion.example.choices[0].message.content
}
```

## Authentication and API Key Requirements

The OpenAI Terraform Provider requires different types of API keys depending on the resources you're managing. Here's a breakdown of which resources require which types of keys:

### Admin API Key vs. Project API Key

| Key Type | Description | Environment Variable | Provider Configuration |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Admin API Key** | Organization-level key with administrative permissions | `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` | `admin_key = var.openai_admin_key` |
| **Project API Key** | Limited to specific project operations | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `api_key = var.openai_api_key` |

### Resources Requiring Admin API Key

These resources and data sources require organization admin permissions:

| Resource/Data Source | Description | 
|----------------------|-------------|
| `openai_project` | Create and manage OpenAI projects |
| `openai_projects` | List all projects in an organization |
| `openai_organization_user` | Retrieve organization user information |
| `openai_organization_users` | List all organization users |
| `openai_project_user` | Manage user access to projects |
| `openai_project_users` | List users in a project |
| `openai_invite` | Create and manage organization invites |
| `openai_invites` | List all organization invites |
| `openai_rate_limit` | Manage rate limits for models in projects |

### Resources That Work with Project API Key

These resources and data sources can be used with project-scoped API keys:

| Resource/Data Source | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `openai_chat_completion` | Generate chat completions |
| `openai_file` | Upload and manage files |
| `openai_image_generation` | Generate images with DALL-E |
| `openai_embedding` | Create text embeddings |
| `openai_model_response` | Generate text with models |
| `openai_fine_tuning_job` | Create fine-tuning jobs |

### Using the Correct Keys

For proper operation:

1. **Provider Configuration**: Set both keys in the provider block when working with mixed resources:
   ```hcl
   provider "openai" {
     api_key   = var.openai_project_api_key
     admin_key = var.openai_admin_key
   }
   ```

2. **Resource-Specific Keys**: Override the key for specific resources:
   ```hcl
   resource "openai_rate_limit" "example" {
     project_id = "proj_abc123"
     model      = "gpt-4"
     # Rate limits always require an admin key with appropriate permissions
     api_key    = var.openai_admin_key
   }
   ```

3. **Data Source Configuration**: Similar to resources, you can specify which key to use:
   ```hcl
   data "openai_projects" "all" {
     api_key = var.openai_admin_key
   }
   ```

4. **Priority Rules**: When both keys are provided, the provider uses:
   - Admin key for administrative operations (projects, users, etc.)
   - Project key for model usage operations (completions, embeddings, etc.)
   - Resource-specific `api_key` parameter overrides the provider defaults

By using the correct key for each operation, you ensure proper permissions while maintaining security best practices.

## Modules

Reusable modules are available for common patterns:

- [upload](modules/upload/): Upload and import files
- [files](modules/files/): Comprehensive file management
- [fine_tuning](modules/fine_tuning/): Create fine-tuning jobs
- [chat_completion](modules/chat_completion/): Generate chat completions
- [model_response](modules/model_response/): Generate text with comprehensive token usage statistics
- [audio](modules/audio/): Process audio files
- [and many more](modules/)

## Examples

The [examples](examples/) directory contains working examples for all features.

## Initial Setup Recommendations

For initial setup, it's recommended to:

1. Create a `.env` file to store your keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx
   OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY=sk-xxxx
   OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=org-xxxx
   ```

2. Source the file before running Terraform:
   ```bash
   source .env
   terraform apply
   ```

3. Or use a terraform.tfvars file and explicitly configure the provider:
   ```hcl
   # In provider block
   provider "openai" {
     api_key         = var.openai_api_key
     admin_key       = var.openai_admin_key  # For admin operations
     organization_id = var.openai_org_id     # Optional
   }
   ```

## API Key Troubleshooting

If you encounter API key issues:
- Verify the expected environment variables are set.
- Explicitly set keys in provider configuration instead of using environment variables.
- For resource-specific keys, use the `api_key` parameter on supported resources.
